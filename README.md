## CSE102
### Purpose of the course
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Programming course for beginners: This course aims to teach students how to read and write software in the C programming language. Students will become familiar with the procedures necessary to structure and translate problems into steps for coding in a high level computing language. They will learn how to write programs so that others can use them.
